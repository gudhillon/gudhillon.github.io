I am a graduate student researcher working on GPU programming, focused on GPU synchronization and atomic-rmw performance modeling. I have teaching experience in courses Parallel Programming and Computer Systems. My research interests lie heterogeneous architectures and parallel programming models, specfically in studying the trade-offs between specialization and portability in the context of GPU cross-vendor performance. I am a prospective PhD applicant for Fall 2025.
